## Overview
This repository contains all (ongoing) research developmental work on Adaptive Deferred-Decision Trajectory Optimization **(Adaptive-DDTO)**, a robust path-planning algorithm which maintains multiple targets in the reachable set of the ego vehicle and adaptively recomputes once the target count falls below a preset threshold. An implementation of **Adaptive-DDTO** for the quadcopter landing problem (as described in the HALO research paper, see below) is provided in the ðŸ“‚`src` folder. Please see the following papers for more context:
- [HALO: Hazard-Aware Landing Optimization for Autonomous Systems]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01583](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10160655))
- [Deferring Decision in Multi-target Trajectory Optimization](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2022-1583) (along with [this presentation](https://www.aa.washington.edu/sites/aa/files/news/2022%20Research%20Showcase%20pdfs/Purna_DDTO_poster.pdf))

## Setup
This repository contains entirely Julia code, with associated Manifest/Project files at the top level (for more information on how Julia works, see [the Julia tutorials page](https://julialang.org/learning/tutorials/)). All code is contained within the ðŸ“‚`src` folder, which notably contains a ðŸ“œ`demo.ipynb` jupyter notebook file that demonstrates the capabilities of Adaptive-DDTO on a sandbox problem, along with all associated solving, plotting and utility files. Currently, you will need to have all packages mentioned in ðŸ“œ`src/setup.jl` for both internal use in this package, and for use in the HALO framework as a submodule.
